- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

House:
    - Constructor: To include a nickname for the house, if it had one.
    - moveIn: To move in multiple students at a time.

Library
    - checkOut: To check out multiple books at a time.
    - addTitle: To add multiple books to the collection at a time.

Cafe
    - Constructor: ToÂ default to one floor.
    - buyCoffee: To default to a regular black coffee (no cream or sugar).

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It was difficult to think of logical defaults for constructors. I was thinking of overloading the Library constructor, but there was no reasonable and realistic default given the attributes we were given in the first place, so I ended up just overloading two methods within the class instead. 

It was helpful to talk out the assignment with somebody in plain English first, since this assignment 1. could get confusing from all the matching method names from overloading/overriding, and 2. the examples we base the classes off of are from our real life experiences.
